Meteor CV app
==

CV app for creating, maintaining and sharing simpler and more beautiful CVs â€“ Made with Meteor. The rationale for this app is to make managing CV easier; save time from editing and formatting; stop headaches with formatting nightmares with e.g. M*** Word; have your CV online for anyone to access; make it easy to adjust the contents and who can see what;

I aim to make this project a way to rethink how employer and employee connect. CV might be a outdated form of showing your skills. Maybe this online CV can suggest a new way to show our competencies. Maybe there are other forms that best suits the needs of employer and employee.

This app is still in an initial stage and is primitive. It lacks a lot of functions.

Planned features include:
* PDF generation
  * I still haven't figured out an easy way to generate PDF with Meteor. Any help is welcome. Maybe using some Node package is necessary instead of existing Meteor packages.
* Creation and management of CV (Now there is one CV to fill and update)
* Share CV function
* Dynamic CV contents
* Multimedia CV contents
