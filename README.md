## A Meteor based CV app
==

CV app for creating, maintaining and sharing simpler and more beautiful CVs â€“ Made with Meteor. The rationale for this app is to simplify managing your CV easier, save time from editing and formatting; stop headaches with formatting nightmares with some commonly used commercial softwares, display CV online without depending on LinkedIn's social obligations and make it easy to adjust the contents.

I aim to make this project a way to rethink how employer and employee connect. A paper CV might be an outdated form of showing your skills. Today we can move from one roll to another quicker, we (have to) learn new skills faster, hence the need to have a 'live' CV that is up to date. This online CV can perhaps suggest a new way to show our competencies and experiences that live up to the speed of today's fast moving world.

This app is still in an initial stage and is primitive. It lacks a lot of functions. Any ideas, suggestions or contributions are deeply appreciated and welcome!

Planned features include:
* PDF export
  * I still haven't figured out an easy way to generate PDF with Meteor. Any help is welcome. Maybe using some Node package is necessary instead of existing Meteor packages
* Templates option as suggested by @haraldur12
* Internationalisation as suggested by @haraldur12
* Creation and management of CV (Now there is one CV to fill and update)
* Share CV function
* Dynamic CV contents
* Multimedia CV contents
